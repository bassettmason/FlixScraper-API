# Automated Top Ten Movie Playlists API

This Flask-based API was designed to help automate playlists for movie suggestions in Trakt, but it can be used for any software that would like automated top ten lists of the top streaming services out right now.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/top-ten-movie-playlists-api.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

javascript
Copy code

3. Set the `TOKEN` environment variable to your secret token:

export TOKEN=your-secret-token

markdown
Copy code

4. Run the server:

python app.py

javascript
Copy code

5. Send a GET request to the `/api/topten` endpoint with the `data` and `token` parameters. For example:
Current available services list is "netflix", "amazon-prime", "hbo", "hulu", "disney", "paramount-plus

http://localhost:8000/api/topten?data=netflix&token=your-secret-token

This will return a JSON response with the top ten movies for Netflix.
