Prince of Darkness, 1987
Nothing has stuck with me quite like Session 9.
Trilogy of Terror.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and the Zuni doll terrified me!  Still does.
Irreversible. It's about how truly bleak human evil is.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as an adult this is the only film that's scared me.
[Rec] (2007)  The Spanish original not the English language American remake "Quarantine". It was a lying in my bed with the covers up to my chin sensory overload type of experience for me.
Sinister (2012) also really unnerved me. I had a hard time getting through this one.
You could also maybe try the Australian film called The Loved Ones (2009).
Blair Witch when it first came out. At the time I was like 11 or 12 and the media around it really hyped it up to be real. And I believed it. Haven’t really been scared of a movie since.
As bad as it ages the Nightmare on Elm Street scared the hell out of me when I was young
The Exorcist (1973) 
The build up is "slow paced" (for lack of better word) but imo the scary moments are really freaky/scary.
The Autopsy Of Jane Doe.
Hereditary. No thank you. Nope.
Ichi the Killer
Salems Lot and Jaws terrified me as a kid. Jaws still does. I can’t watch sharks in any capacity though.
Blair Witch when it first came out, and before much of the hype washed away.
The Fourth Kind 2009.
The Strangers (2008). It’s just so simple. Plausible. Unsettling.
For me...home invasion movies are way scarier than  paranormal or monster movies.  I would suggest "Funny games" and "The Strangers"....
Speak no evil. It hit me at the right place at the right time.
Still Idiocracy
The Woman in Black (original) OR The Changeling
Signs. when you first see the alien
The Exorcist (1973)
Paranormal Activity. The original one. That scene of her getting dragged down the hallway haunts me.
Paranormal activity. A camera with nightvision watching people sleep is creepy enough but the anticipation of something to happen got me good. I think the 3rd one put the camera on a slow panning tripod so when it panned back to an area you had seen and something was different it sent shivers up my spine.
Inland Empire was creepy as hell the first time I saw it.
Eden Lake
Insidious.. man that scene when the demon is behind the chair was so scary
it follows (2014) terrified me
The only thing that freaks me out is anything that can actually happen. Forget Paranormal, dreams (Freddy Krueger), a guy who can move faster than life (Jason Voorhees). Give me something that can actually happen...
The Strangers (2008)
My list in order:
1. Jacob's Ladder
2. The Shining
3. The Exorcist
4. Aliens
5. Pet Semetary
But none of them are as great as the greatest horror film of all time; Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
No movie has disturbed/unsettled me as much as Hereditary did.   I had so much dread watching that thing and afterwards I felt like I summoned a demon into my house.  I was creeped out for like 3 days after.. pretty sure I slept with a light on that first night as well.
I am glad people keep recommending The Exorcist because it is truly the scariest movie. 
I have heard from many people who said they couldn’t sleep alone after watching that movie. Etc.
Me and my family usually have movie nights and we’ve seen many many scary/horror movies. There have been many scary movies we have seen over and over again BUT for me a onetime viewing of that movie was enough. Recently I have been trying to watch it again but I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to watch that movie again.
I have seen The Grudge, Darkness Falls, The Conjuring 1 and 2, The Nun, and many more scary movies again and again but The Exorcist? No. One time was enough.
Frailty
The Omen (1976).  It’s still one of the scariest ever.
As a kid, 'Salem's Lot. As an adult, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. 🐔💦
 As above, so below  so scary
As a child, the 2 that got me were Ghost Ship and 13 Ghosts (remake). As I got a bit older, it was Silent Hill and Oculus. Now, as I've gotten to where I am now, I haven't watched anything that's scared me for a while. I have watched disturbing movies that have left me feeling uncomfortable..original Martyrs, Starry Eyes, Sinister, Baskin. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, Scream (nostalgia), Candy Candyman, Trick R' Treat, The Conjuring, The Thing, and many more. Lately, I've been watching a lot of great things on Shudder if you have Amazon.
The Descent  it’s anxiety inducing. It’s big on claustrophobic scenes. And if that isn’t enough, it gets scarier from there
Tusk
martyrs (2008)
texas chainsaw massacre
Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer
An American Werewolf in London. The scene at the beginning of the movie where they leave the pub and don’t stick to the road. The howling and sense of dread as they sense something is out there in the dark on the Moor. My god that still freaks me out!
Smile (2022)
The autopsy of Jane Doe
When I saw it in theaters....the ring. I was the perfect age to be more scared than I've ever been seeing another movie before or since.
Oculus
The fourth kind (2009) scared the shit out of my family
The Conjuring
Said it before and I am here to say it again. The ghost and the darkness. Fuck off with that bad energy. It's terrifying! Those lions were basically serial killers in animal forms, they liked it. Oh and it's based on a true story so yeah, nope!
Hell House LLC. It’s my favorite. The ending still haunts me to this day…
Event horizon kept me up more than a few nights
Hellraiser. Saw it as a child and have had occasional nightmares about it ever since. Even thinking about it now gives me cold shivers down my spine.
The Autopsy of Jane Doe scared the living shit out of me
As a kid: The Grudge. The Ring. Gothika. The Evil Dead. The Toothfairy (not sure if that's what it was called, but it freaked me out!)
As an adult: Hereditary and It (remake) are really the only things that come to mind
The Others is a pretty great ghost story.
The exorcist is the only correct answer
Audition is a terrifying movie. A widower auditions ladies for a special project, last 15 minutes are why you watch it.
C.H.U.D 
Seen it once back in the day
(If i'll see it again it might not be that scary)
Months after watching was still avoiding sewer lids at night
Hereditary scared me so badly that I haven’t watched it again since seeing it in theaters. I watch video essays about it and talk about it and think about but it was just too horrific to face again! Which is so shocking to me bc all I do is watch fucked up movies lol
The Dark and the Wicked is the only movie that’s ever scared me as an adult.
Jeepers Creepers
The Witch 2015  As a father, the idea of you and your family being kicked out of a safe community to survive on your own in the wilderness and to fail miserably not even understanding fully why.

shiver
Prince of Darkness, 1987
Nothing has stuck with me quite like Session 9.
Trilogy of Terror.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and the Zuni doll terrified me!  Still does.
Irreversible. It's about how truly bleak human evil is.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as an adult this is the only film that's scared me.
[Rec] (2007)  The Spanish original not the English language American remake "Quarantine". It was a lying in my bed with the covers up to my chin sensory overload type of experience for me.
Sinister (2012) also really unnerved me. I had a hard time getting through this one.
You could also maybe try the Australian film called The Loved Ones (2009).
Blair Witch when it first came out. At the time I was like 11 or 12 and the media around it really hyped it up to be real. And I believed it. Haven’t really been scared of a movie since.
As bad as it ages the Nightmare on Elm Street scared the hell out of me when I was young
The Exorcist (1973) 
The build up is "slow paced" (for lack of better word) but imo the scary moments are really freaky/scary.
The Autopsy Of Jane Doe.
Hereditary. No thank you. Nope.
Ichi the Killer
Salems Lot and Jaws terrified me as a kid. Jaws still does. I can’t watch sharks in any capacity though.
Blair Witch when it first came out, and before much of the hype washed away.
The Fourth Kind 2009.
The Strangers (2008). It’s just so simple. Plausible. Unsettling.
For me...home invasion movies are way scarier than  paranormal or monster movies.  I would suggest "Funny games" and "The Strangers"....
Speak no evil. It hit me at the right place at the right time.
Still Idiocracy
The Woman in Black (original) OR The Changeling
Signs. when you first see the alien
The Exorcist (1973)
Paranormal Activity. The original one. That scene of her getting dragged down the hallway haunts me.
Paranormal activity. A camera with nightvision watching people sleep is creepy enough but the anticipation of something to happen got me good. I think the 3rd one put the camera on a slow panning tripod so when it panned back to an area you had seen and something was different it sent shivers up my spine.
Inland Empire was creepy as hell the first time I saw it.
Eden Lake
Insidious.. man that scene when the demon is behind the chair was so scary
it follows (2014) terrified me
The only thing that freaks me out is anything that can actually happen. Forget Paranormal, dreams (Freddy Krueger), a guy who can move faster than life (Jason Voorhees). Give me something that can actually happen...
The Strangers (2008)
My list in order:
1. Jacob's Ladder
2. The Shining
3. The Exorcist
4. Aliens
5. Pet Semetary
But none of them are as great as the greatest horror film of all time; Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
No movie has disturbed/unsettled me as much as Hereditary did.   I had so much dread watching that thing and afterwards I felt like I summoned a demon into my house.  I was creeped out for like 3 days after.. pretty sure I slept with a light on that first night as well.
I am glad people keep recommending The Exorcist because it is truly the scariest movie. 
I have heard from many people who said they couldn’t sleep alone after watching that movie. Etc.
Me and my family usually have movie nights and we’ve seen many many scary/horror movies. There have been many scary movies we have seen over and over again BUT for me a onetime viewing of that movie was enough. Recently I have been trying to watch it again but I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to watch that movie again.
I have seen The Grudge, Darkness Falls, The Conjuring 1 and 2, The Nun, and many more scary movies again and again but The Exorcist? No. One time was enough.
Frailty
The Omen (1976).  It’s still one of the scariest ever.
As a kid, 'Salem's Lot. As an adult, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. 🐔💦
 As above, so below  so scary
As a child, the 2 that got me were Ghost Ship and 13 Ghosts (remake). As I got a bit older, it was Silent Hill and Oculus. Now, as I've gotten to where I am now, I haven't watched anything that's scared me for a while. I have watched disturbing movies that have left me feeling uncomfortable..original Martyrs, Starry Eyes, Sinister, Baskin. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, Scream (nostalgia), Candy Candyman, Trick R' Treat, The Conjuring, The Thing, and many more. Lately, I've been watching a lot of great things on Shudder if you have Amazon.
The Descent  it’s anxiety inducing. It’s big on claustrophobic scenes. And if that isn’t enough, it gets scarier from there

texas chainsaw massacre
Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer
An American Werewolf in London. The scene at the beginning of the movie where they leave the pub and don’t stick to the road. The howling and sense of dread as they sense something is out there in the dark on the Moor. My god that still freaks me out!
Smile (2022)
The autopsy of Jane Doe
When I saw it in theaters....the ring. I was the perfect age to be more scared than I've ever been seeing another movie before or since.
Oculus
The fourth kind (2009) scared the shit out of my family
The Conjuring
Said it before and I am here to say it again. The ghost and the darkness. Fuck off with that bad energy. It's terrifying! Those lions were basically serial killers in animal forms, they liked it. Oh and it's based on a true story so yeah, nope!
Hell House LLC. It’s my favorite. The ending still haunts me to this day…
Event horizon kept me up more than a few nights
Hellraiser. Saw it as a child and have had occasional nightmares about it ever since. Even thinking about it now gives me cold shivers down my spine.
The Autopsy of Jane Doe scared the living shit out of me
As a kid: The Grudge. The Ring. Gothika. The Evil Dead. The Toothfairy (not sure if that's what it was called, but it freaked me out!)
As an adult: Hereditary and It (remake) are really the only things that come to mind
The Others is a pretty great ghost story.
The exorcist is the only correct answer
Audition is a terrifying movie. A widower auditions ladies for a special project, last 15 minutes are why you watch it.
C.H.U.D 
Seen it once back in the day
(If i'll see it again it might not be that scary)
Months after watching was still avoiding sewer lids at night
Hereditary scared me so badly that I haven’t watched it again since seeing it in theaters. I watch video essays about it and talk about it and think about but it was just too horrific to face again! Which is so shocking to me bc all I do is watch fucked up movies lol
The Dark and the Wicked is the only movie that’s ever scared me as an adult.

Prince of Darkness, 1987
Nothing has stuck with me quite like Session 9.
Trilogy of Terror.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and the Zuni doll terrified me!  Still does.
Irreversible. It's about how truly bleak human evil is.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as an adult this is the only film that's scared me.
[Rec] (2007)  The Spanish original not the English language American remake "Quarantine". It was a lying in my bed with the covers up to my chin sensory overload type of experience for me.
Sinister (2012) also really unnerved me. I had a hard time getting through this one.
You could also maybe try the Australian film called The Loved Ones (2009).
Blair Witch when it first came out. At the time I was like 11 or 12 and the media around it really hyped it up to be real. And I believed it. Haven’t really been scared of a movie since.
As bad as it ages the Nightmare on Elm Street scared the hell out of me when I was young
The Exorcist (1973) 
The build up is "slow paced" (for lack of better word) but imo the scary moments are really freaky/scary.
The Autopsy Of Jane Doe.
Hereditary. No thank you. Nope.
Ichi the Killer
Salems Lot and Jaws terrified me as a kid. Jaws still does. I can’t watch sharks in any capacity though.
Blair Witch when it first came out, and before much of the hype washed away.
The Fourth Kind 2009.
The Strangers (2008). It’s just so simple. Plausible. Unsettling.
For me...home invasion movies are way scarier than  paranormal or monster movies.  I would suggest "Funny games" and "The Strangers"....
Speak no evil. It hit me at the right place at the right time.
Still Idiocracy
The Woman in Black (original) OR The Changeling
Signs. when you first see the alien
The Exorcist (1973)
Paranormal Activity. The original one. That scene of her getting dragged down the hallway haunts me.
Paranormal activity. A camera with nightvision watching people sleep is creepy enough but the anticipation of something to happen got me good. I think the 3rd one put the camera on a slow panning tripod so when it panned back to an area you had seen and something was different it sent shivers up my spine.
Inland Empire was creepy as hell the first time I saw it.
Eden Lake
Insidious.. man that scene when the demon is behind the chair was so scary
it follows (2014) terrified me
The only thing that freaks me out is anything that can actually happen. Forget Paranormal, dreams (Freddy Krueger), a guy who can move faster than life (Jason Voorhees). Give me something that can actually happen...
The Strangers (2008)
My list in order:
1. Jacob's Ladder
2. The Shining
3. The Exorcist
4. Aliens
5. Pet Semetary
But none of them are as great as the greatest horror film of all time; Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
No movie has disturbed/unsettled me as much as Hereditary did.   I had so much dread watching that thing and afterwards I felt like I summoned a demon into my house.  I was creeped out for like 3 days after.. pretty sure I slept with a light on that first night as well.
I am glad people keep recommending The Exorcist because it is truly the scariest movie. 
I have heard from many people who said they couldn’t sleep alone after watching that movie. Etc.
Me and my family usually have movie nights and we’ve seen many many scary/horror movies. There have been many scary movies we have seen over and over again BUT for me a onetime viewing of that movie was enough. Recently I have been trying to watch it again but I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to watch that movie again.
I have seen The Grudge, Darkness Falls, The Conjuring 1 and 2, The Nun, and many more scary movies again and again but The Exorcist? No. One time was enough.
Frailty
The Omen (1976).  It’s still one of the scariest ever.
As a kid, 'Salem's Lot. As an adult, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. 🐔💦
 As above, so below  so scary
As a child, the 2 that got me were Ghost Ship and 13 Ghosts (remake). As I got a bit older, it was Silent Hill and Oculus. Now, as I've gotten to where I am now, I haven't watched anything that's scared me for a while. I have watched disturbing movies that have left me feeling uncomfortable..original Martyrs, Starry Eyes, Sinister, Baskin. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, Scream (nostalgia), Candy Candyman, Trick R' Treat, The Conjuring, The Thing, and many more. Lately, I've been watching a lot of great things on Shudder if you have Amazon.
The Descent  it’s anxiety inducing. It’s big on claustrophobic scenes. And if that isn’t enough, it gets scarier from there
Tusk
martyrs (2008)
texas chainsaw massacre
Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer
An American Werewolf in London. The scene at the beginning of the movie where they leave the pub and don’t stick to the road. The howling and sense of dread as they sense something is out there in the dark on the Moor. My god that still freaks me out!
Smile (2022)
The autopsy of Jane Doe
When I saw it in theaters....the ring. I was the perfect age to be more scared than I've ever been seeing another movie before or since.
Oculus
The fourth kind (2009) scared the shit out of my family
The Conjuring
tie between Angst and The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes
Said it before and I am here to say it again. The ghost and the darkness. Fuck off with that bad energy. It's terrifying! Those lions were basically serial killers in animal forms, they liked it. Oh and it's based on a true story so yeah, nope!
I'd say... Rec (2009)
Back in the early seventies I used to hitchhike all the time and I went and saw Texas Chain Saw Massacre at the drivein. Scariest movie ever and never hitchhiked again.
Hellraiser. Saw it as a child and have had occasional nightmares about it ever since. Even thinking about it now gives me cold shivers down my spine.
The Autopsy of Jane Doe scared the living shit out of me
Honestly, the first paranormal activity, when it was first released, scared the living SHIT out of me
Martyrs had me fucked up.
Skinamarink made me super uneasy, especially the longer it sat with me.
As a kid: The Grudge. The Ring. Gothika. The Evil Dead. The Toothfairy (not sure if that's what it was called, but it freaked me out!)
As an adult: Hereditary and It (remake) are really the only things that come to mind
I think probably Suspiria? The 2018 one. It Chapter 1 and Us are both up there, too.
The exorcist is the only correct answer
Audition is a terrifying movie. A widower auditions ladies for a special project, last 15 minutes are why you watch it.
C.H.U.D 
Seen it once back in the day
(If i'll see it again it might not be that scary)
Months after watching was still avoiding sewer lids at night
Hereditary scared me so badly that I haven’t watched it again since seeing it in theaters. I watch video essays about it and talk about it and think about but it was just too horrific to face again! Which is so shocking to me bc all I do is watch fucked up movies lol
The Dark and the Wicked is the only movie that’s ever scared me as an adult.
Jeepers Creepers
The Witch 2015  As a father, the idea of you and your family being kicked out of a safe community to survive on your own in the wilderness and to fail miserably not even understanding fully why.

I love horror movies. Not too many movies scare me as an adult. Jump ya. But when I was a kid I watched Pumpkinhead and it  traumatized me.  Pet Sematary is close second
Hereditary, one of the only horror movies that I often think about

After horror seemingly got campy and cheesy, in 1998, the ring came out and I was scared shitless.
Carnival of Souls (1962). There's an eerie atmosphere throughout the whole movie. Even the music is creepy.
I once was half asleep watching "Sphere". Felt eerie for several days.

Prince of Darkness, 1987
Nothing has stuck with me quite like Session 9.
Trilogy of Terror.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and the Zuni doll terrified me!  Still does.
Irreversible. It's about how truly bleak human evil is.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as an adult this is the only film that's scared me.
[Rec] (2007)  The Spanish original not the English language American remake "Quarantine". It was a lying in my bed with the covers up to my chin sensory overload type of experience for me.
Sinister (2012) also really unnerved me. I had a hard time getting through this one.
You could also maybe try the Australian film called The Loved Ones (2009).
Blair Witch when it first came out. At the time I was like 11 or 12 and the media around it really hyped it up to be real. And I believed it. Haven’t really been scared of a movie since.
As bad as it ages the Nightmare on Elm Street scared the hell out of me when I was young
The Exorcist (1973) 
The build up is "slow paced" (for lack of better word) but imo the scary moments are really freaky/scary.
The Autopsy Of Jane Doe.
Hereditary. No thank you. Nope.
Ichi the Killer
Salems Lot and Jaws terrified me as a kid. Jaws still does. I can’t watch sharks in any capacity though.
Blair Witch when it first came out, and before much of the hype washed away.
The Fourth Kind 2009.
The Strangers (2008). It’s just so simple. Plausible. Unsettling.
For me...home invasion movies are way scarier than  paranormal or monster movies.  I would suggest "Funny games" and "The Strangers"....
Speak no evil. It hit me at the right place at the right time.
Still Idiocracy
The Woman in Black (original) OR The Changeling
Signs. when you first see the alien
The Exorcist (1973)
Paranormal Activity. The original one. That scene of her getting dragged down the hallway haunts me.
Paranormal activity. A camera with nightvision watching people sleep is creepy enough but the anticipation of something to happen got me good. I think the 3rd one put the camera on a slow panning tripod so when it panned back to an area you had seen and something was different it sent shivers up my spine.
Inland Empire was creepy as hell the first time I saw it.
Eden Lake
Insidious.. man that scene when the demon is behind the chair was so scary
it follows (2014) terrified me
The only thing that freaks me out is anything that can actually happen. Forget Paranormal, dreams (Freddy Krueger), a guy who can move faster than life (Jason Voorhees). Give me something that can actually happen...
The Strangers (2008)
My list in order:
1. Jacob's Ladder
2. The Shining
3. The Exorcist
4. Aliens
5. Pet Semetary
But none of them are as great as the greatest horror film of all time; Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
No movie has disturbed/unsettled me as much as Hereditary did.   I had so much dread watching that thing and afterwards I felt like I summoned a demon into my house.  I was creeped out for like 3 days after.. pretty sure I slept with a light on that first night as well.
I am glad people keep recommending The Exorcist because it is truly the scariest movie. 
I have heard from many people who said they couldn’t sleep alone after watching that movie. Etc.
Me and my family usually have movie nights and we’ve seen many many scary/horror movies. There have been many scary movies we have seen over and over again BUT for me a onetime viewing of that movie was enough. Recently I have been trying to watch it again but I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to watch that movie again.
I have seen The Grudge, Darkness Falls, The Conjuring 1 and 2, The Nun, and many more scary movies again and again but The Exorcist? No. One time was enough.
Frailty
The Omen (1976).  It’s still one of the scariest ever.
As a kid, 'Salem's Lot. As an adult, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. 🐔💦
 As above, so below  so scary
As a child, the 2 that got me were Ghost Ship and 13 Ghosts (remake). As I got a bit older, it was Silent Hill and Oculus. Now, as I've gotten to where I am now, I haven't watched anything that's scared me for a while. I have watched disturbing movies that have left me feeling uncomfortable..original Martyrs, Starry Eyes, Sinister, Baskin. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, Scream (nostalgia), Candy Candyman, Trick R' Treat, The Conjuring, The Thing, and many more. Lately, I've been watching a lot of great things on Shudder if you have Amazon.
The Descent  it’s anxiety inducing. It’s big on claustrophobic scenes. And if that isn’t enough, it gets scarier from there

texas chainsaw massacre
Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer
An American Werewolf in London. The scene at the beginning of the movie where they leave the pub and don’t stick to the road. The howling and sense of dread as they sense something is out there in the dark on the Moor. My god that still freaks me out!
Smile (2022)
The autopsy of Jane Doe

Oculus
The fourth kind (2009) scared the shit out of my family
The Conjuring
tie between Angst and The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes
Said it before and I am here to say it again. The ghost and the darkness. Fuck off with that bad energy. It's terrifying! Those lions were basically serial killers in animal forms, they liked it. Oh and it's based on a true story so yeah, nope!
I'd say... Rec (2009)
Back in the early seventies I used to hitchhike all the time and I went and saw Texas Chain Saw Massacre at the drivein. Scariest movie ever and never hitchhiked again.
Hell House LLC. It’s my favorite. The ending still haunts me to this day…
Event horizon kept me up more than a few nights
Hellraiser. Saw it as a child and have had occasional nightmares about it ever since. Even thinking about it now gives me cold shivers down my spine.
The Autopsy of Jane Doe scared the living shit out of me
Martyrs had me fucked up.
Skinamarink made me super uneasy, especially the longer it sat with me.
As a kid: The Grudge. The Ring. Gothika. The Evil Dead. The Toothfairy (not sure if that's what it was called, but it freaked me out!)
As an adult: Hereditary and It (remake) are really the only things that come to mind
The exorcist is the only correct answer
Audition is a terrifying movie. A widower auditions ladies for a special project, last 15 minutes are why you watch it.
C.H.U.D 
Seen it once back in the day
(If i'll see it again it might not be that scary)
Months after watching was still avoiding sewer lids at night
Hereditary scared me so badly that I haven’t watched it again since seeing it in theaters. I watch video essays about it and talk about it and think about but it was just too horrific to face again! Which is so shocking to me bc all I do is watch fucked up movies lol
The Dark and the Wicked is the only movie that’s ever scared me as an adult.

Prince of Darkness, 1987
Nothing has stuck with me quite like Session 9.
Trilogy of Terror.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and the Zuni doll terrified me!  Still does.
Irreversible. It's about how truly bleak human evil is.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) as an adult this is the only film that's scared me.
[Rec] (2007)  The Spanish original not the English language American remake "Quarantine". It was a lying in my bed with the covers up to my chin sensory overload type of experience for me.
Sinister (2012) also really unnerved me. I had a hard time getting through this one.
You could also maybe try the Australian film called The Loved Ones (2009).
Blair Witch when it first came out. At the time I was like 11 or 12 and the media around it really hyped it up to be real. And I believed it. Haven’t really been scared of a movie since.
As bad as it ages the Nightmare on Elm Street scared the hell out of me when I was young
The Exorcist (1973) 
The build up is "slow paced" (for lack of better word) but imo the scary moments are really freaky/scary.
The Autopsy Of Jane Doe.
Hereditary. No thank you. Nope.
Ichi the Killer
Salems Lot and Jaws terrified me as a kid. Jaws still does. I can’t watch sharks in any capacity though.
Blair Witch when it first came out, and before much of the hype washed away.
The Fourth Kind 2009.
The Strangers (2008). It’s just so simple. Plausible. Unsettling.
For me...home invasion movies are way scarier than  paranormal or monster movies.  I would suggest "Funny games" and "The Strangers"....
Speak no evil. It hit me at the right place at the right time.
Still Idiocracy
The Woman in Black (original) OR The Changeling
Signs. when you first see the alien
The Exorcist (1973)
Paranormal Activity. The original one. That scene of her getting dragged down the hallway haunts me.
Paranormal activity. A camera with nightvision watching people sleep is creepy enough but the anticipation of something to happen got me good. I think the 3rd one put the camera on a slow panning tripod so when it panned back to an area you had seen and something was different it sent shivers up my spine.
Inland Empire was creepy as hell the first time I saw it.
Eden Lake
Insidious.. man that scene when the demon is behind the chair was so scary
it follows (2014) terrified me
The only thing that freaks me out is anything that can actually happen. Forget Paranormal, dreams (Freddy Krueger), a guy who can move faster than life (Jason Voorhees). Give me something that can actually happen...
The Strangers (2008)
My list in order:
1. Jacob's Ladder
2. The Shining
3. The Exorcist
4. Aliens
5. Pet Semetary
But none of them are as great as the greatest horror film of all time; Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
No movie has disturbed/unsettled me as much as Hereditary did.   I had so much dread watching that thing and afterwards I felt like I summoned a demon into my house.  I was creeped out for like 3 days after.. pretty sure I slept with a light on that first night as well.
I am glad people keep recommending The Exorcist because it is truly the scariest movie. 
I have heard from many people who said they couldn’t sleep alone after watching that movie. Etc.
Me and my family usually have movie nights and we’ve seen many many scary/horror movies. There have been many scary movies we have seen over and over again BUT for me a onetime viewing of that movie was enough. Recently I have been trying to watch it again but I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to watch that movie again.
I have seen The Grudge, Darkness Falls, The Conjuring 1 and 2, The Nun, and many more scary movies again and again but The Exorcist? No. One time was enough.
Frailty
The Omen (1976).  It’s still one of the scariest ever.
As a kid, 'Salem's Lot. As an adult, The Changeling, starring George C. Scott. 🐔💦
 As above, so below  so scary
As a child, the 2 that got me were Ghost Ship and 13 Ghosts (remake). As I got a bit older, it was Silent Hill and Oculus. Now, as I've gotten to where I am now, I haven't watched anything that's scared me for a while. I have watched disturbing movies that have left me feeling uncomfortable..original Martyrs, Starry Eyes, Sinister, Baskin. Some of my favorites are The Exorcist, Scream (nostalgia), Candy Candyman, Trick R' Treat, The Conjuring, The Thing, and many more. Lately, I've been watching a lot of great things on Shudder if you have Amazon.
The Descent  it’s anxiety inducing. It’s big on claustrophobic scenes. And if that isn’t enough, it gets scarier from there

martyrs (2008)
texas chainsaw massacre
Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer
An American Werewolf in London. The scene at the beginning of the movie where they leave the pub and don’t stick to the road. The howling and sense of dread as they sense something is out there in the dark on the Moor. My god that still freaks me out!
Smile (2022)
The autopsy of Jane Doe
When I saw it in theaters....the ring. I was the perfect age to be more scared than I've ever been seeing another movie before or since.
Oculus
The fourth kind (2009) scared the shit out of my family
The Conjuring
tie between Angst and The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes
Said it before and I am here to say it again. The ghost and the darkness. Fuck off with that bad energy. It's terrifying! Those lions were basically serial killers in animal forms, they liked it. Oh and it's based on a true story so yeah, nope!
I'd say... Rec (2009)
Back in the early seventies I used to hitchhike all the time and I went and saw Texas Chain Saw Massacre at the drivein. Scariest movie ever and never hitchhiked again.
Hell House LLC. It’s my favorite. The ending still haunts me to this day…
Hellraiser. Saw it as a child and have had occasional nightmares about it ever since. Even thinking about it now gives me cold shivers down my spine.
The Autopsy of Jane Doe scared the living shit out of me
As a kid: The Grudge. The Ring. Gothika. The Evil Dead. The Toothfairy (not sure if that's what it was called, but it freaked me out!)
As an adult: Hereditary and It (remake) are really the only things that come to mind
The exorcist is the only correct answer
Audition is a terrifying movie. A widower auditions ladies for a special project, last 15 minutes are why you watch it.
C.H.U.D 
Seen it once back in the day
(If i'll see it again it might not be that scary)
Months after watching was still avoiding sewer lids at night
Hereditary scared me so badly that I haven’t watched it again since seeing it in theaters. I watch video essays about it and talk about it and think about but it was just too horrific to face again! Which is so shocking to me bc all I do is watch fucked up movies lol
The Dark and the Wicked is the only movie that’s ever scared me as an adult.

Movies with swashbuckling heroes is not my cup of tea, so I asked ChatGPT.
Sure, here are some movies similar to the John Wick series:
The Equalizer (2014)  This movie stars Denzel Washington as a former CIA operative who comes out of retirement to help a young girl in trouble.
Atomic Blonde (2017)  This movie stars Charlize Theron as an undercover MI6 agent who must navigate through the city of Berlin during the Cold War.
The Bourne series (20022016)  This series follows the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA operative who suffers from amnesia and tries to piece together his past while evading his former employers.
Taken (2008)  This movie stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent who goes on a mission to rescue his daughter from human traffickers.
Haywire (2011)  This movie stars Gina Carano as a covert operative who seeks revenge against those who betrayed her.
The Raid: Redemption (2011)  This Indonesian action film follows a SWAT team as they raid a highrise building controlled by a ruthless drug lord.
John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 3  Parabellum (2019)  If you haven't already seen them, the sequels to the original John Wick movie continue the story of the assassin John Wick as he faces even more challenges.
I hope these recommendations help you find a movie that you will enjoy!

The Raid: Redemption (2011)  This Indonesian action film follows a SWAT team as they raid a highrise building controlled by a ruthless drug lord.
John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 3  Parabellum (2019)  If you haven't already seen them, the sequels to the original John Wick movie continue the story of the assassin John Wick as he faces even more challenges.
